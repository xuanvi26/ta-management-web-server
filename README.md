# ta-management-web-server

Seeded users (username, password):
- student, student
- ta, student
- prof, student
- admin, student
- sysop, student

Assumption/ clarification:
- TAs / profs can exist in the system without being an actual user (with an account)
- In order to test with the seeded data that we currently have in our databases:
please use either COMP 202, COMP 205, COMP 111, COMP 222 when searching for a course in Manage TAs, as those are the courses with TAs in them
- If you would like to import or manually add data, please make sure that your naming and formatting is consistent as everything in our website is case and space sensitive (e.g., if you add a course called "COMP 307" called "Web Development" in the Sysop task, manual add courses (or import courses through a csv), then you must use "COMP 307"  (not "comp307" or any other format) and "Web Development" (not "web dev" or any other format) when you add a TA in TA administration
